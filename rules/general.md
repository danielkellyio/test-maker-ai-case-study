Some general rules for the entire project:

- When adding a new feature, do NOT alter code that is already in place unless necessary. If you do alter existing code besides simply moving it up or down in the file where it already exists, warn me (❗️SHOUT WITH LARGE LETTERS❗️) and thoroughly explain your reasoning for moving it.

- leave explanatory comments inline in the code to help me better understand what's happening in a file when I come back to it later. Use these comments to explain why the code was written as it was.

- when creating a new feature start with the server side API endpoint. DO NOT start creating components immediately if the API endponts aren't already in place
