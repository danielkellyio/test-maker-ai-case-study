TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern Vue development. Let's explore how to leverage it effectively.

## Type Safety First

Strong typing brings numerous benefits:

- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE support
- Self-documenting code
- Improved maintainability

## Essential Patterns

Here are some patterns you should know:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const useUser = () => {
  const user = ref<User | null>(null);
  // ...
};
```
