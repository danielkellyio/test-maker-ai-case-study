Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm excited to share my experiences and insights about modern web development.

## Why I Started This Blog

I believe in learning in public. _By sharing what we learn, we not only help others but also solidify our own understanding._

> The best way to learn is to build something and share it with others.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- Vue 3 and the Composition API
- TypeScript best practices
- Modern CSS with Tailwind
- Real-world development challenges
- Performance optimization
- Testing strategies

## Core Development Principles

When building modern web applications, I follow these key principles:

1. **Type Safety First**

   - Write self-documenting code
   - Catch errors early in development
   - Improve maintainability

2. **Component-Driven Development**

   - Build reusable components
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Follow Vue best practices

3. **Performance Matters**
   - Optimize for core web vitals
   - Implement proper lazy loading
   - Monitor and measure impact
